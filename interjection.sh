TEMPLATE="\
I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Linux, \
is in fact, GNU/${SLASH}/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus ${PLUS} \
plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component \
of a fully functioning GNU/${SLASH} system made useful by the GNU/${SLASH} corelibs, shell \
utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.

Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU/${SLASH} system every day, \
without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU/${SLASH} \
which is widely used today is often called \"Linux\", and many of its users are \
not aware that it is basically the GNU/${SLASH} system, developed by the GNU Project.

There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a \
part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system \
that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. \
The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; \
it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is \
normally used in combination with the GNU/${SLASH} operating system: the whole \
system is basically GNU with ${COMMA}, and Linux added, or GNU/${SLASH}/Linux. \
All the so-called \"Linux\" distributions are really distributions of GNU/${SLASH}/Linux.
